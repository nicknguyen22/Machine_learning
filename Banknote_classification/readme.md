#R - Banknotes classification with Logistic Regression, LDA and QDA

This R notebook compares the results of multiple regression algorithms for the 
detection of forged banknotes. We'll be evaluating the performance of logistic 
regression analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and quadratic discriminant 
analysis (QDA) to determine their effectiveness in distinguishing genuine banknotes from forged ones.
