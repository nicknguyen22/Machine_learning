Python - Classifying Fashion with a 4-Layer Convolutional Neural Network

This notebook utilises a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier constructed 
using the Keras deep learning library. The CNN architecture comprises four convolutional 
layers and has been fine-tuned using Optuna hyperparameter optimisation and augmented with 
data augmentation techniques. The results are visualised using TensorBoard.
