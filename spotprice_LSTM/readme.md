# Electricity Spot Price Prediction using TSTM (TensorFlow & Pytorch)

This Python notebook demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of 
recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict electricity spot prices. The notebook provides 
implementations using both TensorFlow and PyTorch, allowing users to compare and contrast the two \
popular libraries for LSTM modeling and forecasting.
