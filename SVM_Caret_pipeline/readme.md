# R - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithms via the Caret Pipeline

We harness the power of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms within the Caret 
Pipeline to tackle the critical task of classifying breast cancer patients. In this 
notebook, we'll explore how SVM, coupled with efficient data preprocessing and model 
evaluation through the Caret framework, can aid in distinguishing between different
cancer results.
